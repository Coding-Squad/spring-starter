Simple starter app for Spring MVC (using spring boot)

I could not find any simple barebone starter apps that had a working authentication system, orm, and ready to go. 

Every example out there is bloated with a lot of unnecessary loads of crap. Why cant there be just a simple example ?

To run, just clone it then..

mvn install
java -jar target/app-0.0.1-SNAPSHOT.jar   (or run Application.java within eclipse)





Uses thymeleaf for templating, i find this one very clean.
Mysql for DB, configure it via application.properties
